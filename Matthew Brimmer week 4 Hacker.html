//EXERCISE
//Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in terms of a given planet's solar years.


//DETAILS
// Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

// Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
// Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
// Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
// Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
// Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
// Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
// Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
// Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

// So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth-years old.


//Place code below:
function yourAge (ageInSeconds, planet) {
  var ageInSeconds;
  var planet = planet.toLowerCase();
  var ageYears = ageInSeconds / 31557600;
  var solarAge;
  if (planet === 'mercury') {
    solarAge = ageYears / .2408467;
  } else if (planet === 'venus') {
    solarAge = ageYears / .61519726;
  } else if (planet === 'mars') {
    solarAge = ageYears / 1.8808158;
  } else if (planet === 'jupiter') {
    solarAge = ageYears / 11.862615;
  } else if (planet === 'saturn') {
    solarAge = ageYears / 29.447498;
  } else if (planet === 'uranus') {
    solarAge = ageYears / 84.016846;
  } else if (planet === 'neptune') {
    solarAge = ageYears / 164.79132;
  } else if (planet === 'earth') {
    solarAge = ageYears;
  }
  console.log('You are ' + solarAge + ' ' + planet + '-years old!');
  return solarAge;
}
