Hacker Track - Week 6

//a) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

var fib;
var f1 = 0;
var f2 = 1;
var evenTotal = 0;
function fibEvenSum () {
	while (f2 < 4000000) {
		fib = f1 + f2;
		f1 = f2;
		f2 = fib;
		if (fib % 2 === 0) {
			evenTotal += fib;
		}
	}
	console.log(evenTotal);
	return evenTotal;
}
fibEvenSum();
